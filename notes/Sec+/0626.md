## 1.1 Sec. Controls
### Control categories
1. Technical Control
- Implemented using systems
- OS contrtol
- Firewwalls, anti-virus...
2. Managerial Control
- Security designs and implementation
- Security polices, standard operating procedures...
3. Operational Control
- Controls implemented by people
- Security guards, awareness programs...
4. Physical Control
- Physical access limitation
- Guard, fences, locks, badge readers...

### Control types
#### Preventive
- Prevent access
- Block access to a resource
- Control Cat.
1. Technical: Firewall
2. Managerial: On-boarding policy
3. Operational: Guard shack
4. Physical: Door lock
#### Deterrent
- Discourage intrusion attempts, make attacker think twice
- **Not directly prevent access**
- Control Cat.
1. Technical: Splash screen
2. Managerial: Demotion
3. Operational: Reception desk 
4. Physical: Waring signs
#### Detective
- Identify intrusion attempts
- Find the issue
- Control Cat.
1. Technical: System logs
2. Managerial: Review login reports
3. Operational: Property patrols 
4. Physical: Motion detectors
#### Corrective
- Apply control after an event has been detected
- Reverse the impact
- Continue operating with minimal downtime
- Correct the problem
- Control Cat.
1. Technical: Backup recovery
2. Managerial: Policies for reporting issues
3. Operational: Contact authorities 
4. Physical: Fire extinguisher
#### Compensating
- Control using other means
- Existing controls aren't sufficient
- May be temporary
- **Prevent the exploitation of a weakness**
- Control Cat.
1. Technical: Block application
2. Managerial: Separation of duties
3. Operational: Require multiple sec. staff 
4. Physical: Power generator
#### Directive
- direct subjects towards security compliance
- **Realtively weak control**
- "Do this, please"
- Control Cat.
1. Technical: File storage policies
2. Managerial: Compliance polices
3. Operational: Security policy training
4. Physical: Sign--Authorized Only

## 1.2 CIA Triad
- Combination of principles
1. Confidentiality
- Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems
- Encryption. Access controls. Two-factor authorization.
2. Intergity
- Messages can't be modified without detection
- **Store and transfer as intended**
- Hashing. Digital signatures. Certificates. Non-repudiation.
3. Availability
- Systems and networks must be up and running
- **accessible to authorized users**
- Redundancy. Fault tolerance. Patching.

### Non-repudiation
- No taking back
- Proof of origin, Proof of integrity

#### Proof of integrity
- Verify data does not change
- Data remains accurate and consistent
- Hashing

#### Proof of origin
- Prove the message was not changed
- Prove the source
- Make sure the signature isn't fake
- private key signature

### AAA framework
1. Identification
- Username
2. Authentication
- Password
3. Authorization
- Access
4. Accounting
- Login time, data sent/received, logout time...

#### Certificate authentication
- Certificate Authority (CA)
    - A signature on the machine

#### Authorization models
1. No authorization model
    - Simple relationship
    - Issues
        - Difficult to understand why authorization may exist
        - Does not scale
2.
